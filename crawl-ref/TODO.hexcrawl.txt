Known bugs:
None

Unknown bugs:
* rare bug: found (once) a configuration in which
    magic missile consistently hit a nearby wall rather than its target. I
    can't see what could be causing this.

TODO for 0.3:
None

TODO one day maybe:
* Support for hex-vaults, i.e. vaults designed for hex.
* Hexify labyrinth (though it's playable as it is - and very scary!)
* chequerboard: -> hequerboard
