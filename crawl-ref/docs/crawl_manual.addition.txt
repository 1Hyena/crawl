Nomes
---------

The stooped, gravel-skinned Nomes are true children of the earth:
stubborn and strong as the stones, and insular as diamonds trapped in
the rocky depths. Few Nomes ever glimpse the light of day, preferring
instead to swim through the walls of their native caverns in search of
ever-prettier gems.  For Nomes can indeed swim through solid rock, stone
or even metal.

To swim through a wall, a Nome first becomes attuned to the earth, a
slow process that leaves Nomes entering a wall vulnerable for a short
time but greatly increases their resilience. Higher attunement allows
passage into harder walls, grants a Nome increasingly tough skin, and
slows the Nome's actions proportionally - rock barely slows a Nome,
but a swim through metal is tantamount to a swim through molasses.
Although attunement gradually decreases when the Nome moves in open air,
the Nome remains in this slowed but more resilient state for some time.

The Nomes' earthy nature is their greatest strength and greatest
weakness.  Nomes are the masters of earth magic, and excel at bashing
enemies with mace or stony fists alike. On the other hand, they are by
nature inflexible in mind, learning at a slow pace and having little
patience for magics foreign to their caverns, and equally inflexible
in body, relying mostly on their diminutive stature to avoid blows.
