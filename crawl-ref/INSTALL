Install instructions for Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup (DCSS)
--------------------------------------------------------
(Last updated on 20070331 for Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup 0.2.)

Building Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup
---------------------------------

Crawl Stone Soup is known to compile successfully on the following
platforms as of version 0.2:

- Any Unix with a recent gcc (and g++), GNU make and libncurses,
  including Linux and Mac OS X. "Recent" is defined as gcc 3.3 or
  newer.
- Microsoft Windows NT/2000/XP. The game will also run on Windows 9X
  and ME. DOS binaries can also be compiled on Windows NT+.

The only supported compiler is gcc (available on almost all Unixes,
and as djgpp for DOS, and MinGW for Windows).

Other platforms are unsupported, but you should be able to build Crawl
on pretty much any operating system with a modern C++ compiler (full
support for the standard C++ library, in particular <string>, the
collection classes and <algorithm> is necessary) and the curses
library.


Optional libraries
------------------

Crawl can be built with some optional features:

* Sounds
* Regular expressions
* User Lua scripts
* Unicode characters for the map (Unix only).

Crawl Stone Soup also uses a level compiler to compile special level
definitions; to make changes to the level compiler, you'll need the
flex and bison/byacc tools (Other lex/yaccs may also work). More
details are available below.

Sounds must be enabled by editing AppHdr.h (uncomment
SOUND_PLAY_COMMAND on Unixes or WINMM_PLAY_SOUNDS on Windows).

Regular expressions require libpcre on non-Unix operating systems. On
Unixes, the standard POSIX regular expression support is adequate for
Crawl's needs.

Stone Soup 0.3 includes Lua 5.1.2 in its source tree. Crawl uses Lua
for dungeon generation. In addition, Crawl has a (rudimentary) Lua
interface for users to run scripts which can do things such as
conditionalise parts of the .crawlrc/init.txt. Such user Lua scripts
are enabled by default, but can be turned off by removing
-DCLUA_BINDINGS from your makefile.

Unicode support needs libncursesw and its header files; these are
usually available in your operating system's package-management
system. Unicode is not supported on Windows or DOS. Some systems, such
as Mac OS X, may have Unicode support available in libncurses itself
(i.e., without a separate libncursesw).


Makefile system
---------------

Crawl uses a selector makefile (under source/makefile) to control what
platform it's building for. Your first step in building Crawl should
be to edit source/makefile and point it at the correct platform
makefile. For instance, if you're building for Windows, you'd use
MAKEFILE=makefile.mgw to build with MinGW for Windows (# is used for
comments in makefiles).

Consult the operating-system specific sections for detailed
information on building Crawl.


Building on Unix (Linux, *BSD, Solaris, etc.)
---------------------------------------------

Prerequisites:

GNU gcc and g++, GNU make, libncurses or libcurses. You need the
development headers for ncurses - they may not be installed by default
on some Unixes.

flex and bison are optional but highly recommended. Recent versions of
byacc are also fine (edit your makefile appropriately).

If you have ncursesw and the development headers (usually in the
/usr/include/ncursesw directory) you can build Crawl with support for
Unicode display characters in the map by setting UNICODE_GLYPHS = y
in makefile.unix.

Building:

* cd to the source directory (you can safely ignore the dolinks.sh and
  domake.sh scripts).

* Edit makefile and make sure that MAKEFILE=makefile.unix is
  uncommented and all other MAKEFILE= lines are commented out.

* If you want to install Crawl for multiple users, edit makefile.unix
  and set SAVEDIR and DATADIR to appropriate directories. This is not
  necessary if only one user is going to play Crawl. Also check
  INSTALLDIR and change it if necessary.
  
* Edit AppHdr.h and check that SAVE_PACKAGE_CMD and LOAD_UNPACKAGE_CMD
  are set correctly for your system. If you do not want your saves
  packaged in a zip archive, it's safe to comment out SAVE_PACKAGE_CMD
  and LOAD_UNPACKAGE_CMD.

* If you don't have (or don't want to use) flex or bison, edit
  makefile.unix and set DOYACC := n. If you want to use byacc instead
  of bison, edit makefile.unix and set YACC := byacc. On some Unixes,
  you may not have flex (but have some other lex), in which case
  you'll have to set LEX := lex in makefile.unix.

* Run make to build the normal (non-wizard) Crawl. On systems such as
  Solaris, you may have to use gmake for GNU make. Make sure your make
  identifies itself as GNU make when you do make --version.

* If you're installing Crawl for multiple users, run make install.
  Crawl will be copied into the directory specified by INSTALLDIR. The
  save and data directories will be created if necessary, and the
  level layout (.des) and help files will be copied to the data
  directory.

* If you'd like users to be able to script Crawl with Lua, you can
  edit AppHdr.h, uncomment
        // #define CLUA_BINDINGS
  clean, and rebuild to compile with user Lua support. See the section
  on Lua (below) for more information.


Building on Mac OS X
--------------------

You can follow the Unix instructions to build Crawl (but note you
still need to install Xcode to get gcc and make), or alternatively you
can use Xcode.

Note that the Unix instructions will build Crawl assuming that your
terminal can display 16 colours. If you're planning to use
Terminal.app (which supports only 8 colours), you should follow the
Mac build instructions below.

* Crawl has been tested with Xcode 2.4 under OS X 10.4.7 on both PPC
  and Intel machines, but is likely to be buildable with earlier
  versions.

* Make sure Xcode is installed. Xcode should be available on the OS X
  install DVD if you haven't already installed it.

* Open the Xcode project (Crawl.xcodeproj) under the "source"
  directory.

* Hit Build in Xcode.

* The default build configuration, Release, will build a ppc/i386
  Universal binary suitable for play on all OS X 10.3.9 or newer
  systems. The other build configurations are intended for development
  and may not result in a binary that can be distributed to others.

* You can also use makefile.osx, which will run xcodebuild from the
  command line.

* If you'd like users to be able to script Crawl with Lua, you can
  edit AppHdr.h, uncomment
        // #define CLUA_BINDINGS
  and rebuild to compile with Lua support. See the section on Lua
  for more information.


Building on Windows (MinGW)
---------------------------

NOTE: You cannot build Windows binaries on Windows 9x/ME using the
MinGW makefile supplied (which needs the cmd.exe shell of the Windows
NT family). If you're on 9x/ME, you can use the Cygwin build
instructions, or build a binary on a Windows NT/2k/XP system (the
binary will run on 9x), or build a DOS binary.

* Install MinGW from http://www.mingw.org. The MinGW 5.0.2 installer
  is best so you don't have to fiddle with individual packages (you
  can mess with the individual packages if you like to, of course). If
  you want to edit the level compiler, also get the flex and bison
  packages (available from the GnuWin32 project on Sourceforge:
  http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/).

* Make sure you have g++ and mingw32-make in your path.

* cd to the the Crawl source directory.

* Build Crawl by running
        mingw32-make MAKEFILE=makefile.mgw

* If you want regular expression support, you can edit AppHdr.h and
  uncomment this line:
        // #define REGEX_PCRE
  Note that there are multiple // #define REGEX_PCRE lines in AppHdr.h
  - find the one in the Windows-specific section.

* If you have flex and bison, edit makefile.mgw and set DOYACC := y.

* If you enabled REGEX_PCRE, add -lpcre to the LIB line in makefile.mgw as:
   LIB = -lpcre -static -lwinmm -L$(LUASRC) -l$(LUALIB) -L$(SQLSRC) -l$(SQLLIB)
  and build Crawl to include regex support.

* When you're done, you should have crawl.exe under a "rel"
  subdirectory.


Building on Windows (cygwin)
----------------------------

* Get Cygwin from http://www.cygwin.com/. When installing, ensure that
  the following packages are selected: gcc, g++, make, flex, bison,
  libncurses-devel. If you'd like to build from svn, install the svn
  client. You may also want to install diff and patch if you'd like to
  apply third party patches, or create your own.

* Once Cygwin is installed, open a Cygwin bash shell (use the Start
  menu, do not double-click bash.exe in Explorer). cd to the Crawl
  source directory.

* Follow the Linux build instructions to build Crawl.


Building for DOS (djgpp)
------------------------

* Install djgpp from http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/. Don't forget to
  include C++ support when the Zip picker asks for what you want. You
  may also have to download GNU make as a separate package. It's
  important to follow the install instructions carefully, because bad
  installs can produce rather confusing error messages.

* Make sure gxx and make are in your PATH.

* If you want to modify the level compiler, install the djgpp flex,
  bison and m4 packages and set DOYACC := y in makefile.dos.

* cd to the Crawl source directory.

* Build Crawl by running
        make MAKEFILE=makefile.dos

* If you want PCRE, edit makefile.dos and change this line:
        CFLAGS   := $(INCLUDES) $(CFWARN) $(CFOTHERS)
  to
        CFLAGS   := $(INCLUDES) $(CFWARN) $(CFOTHERS) -DREGEX_PCRE
  And add -lpcre to the LIB line in makefile.dos, like so:
        LIB = -L$(LUASRC) -l$(LUALIB) -L$(SQLSRC) -l$(SQLLIB) -lpcre
  then build Crawl.

* When the build is done, crawl.exe should be in the source directory.

*****************************************************************************

The level compiler
------------------

Crawl uses a level compiler to read the level design (.des) files in
the source/dat directory.

If you're using one of the standard makefiles, the steps described in
this section are performed automatically:

The level compiler source is in the source/util directory (levcomp.lpp
and levcomp.ypp). The steps involved in building the level compiler
are:

* Run flex on levcomp.lpp to produce the levcomp.lex.cc lexer.
* Run bison on levcomp.ypp to produce the levcomp.tab.cc parser and
  levcomp.tab.h 
* Compile the resulting C++ source files and levcomp.cc and link the
  object files into the Crawl executable.

For convenience on systems that don't have flex/bison, pre-generated
intermediate files are provided under source/prebuilt. The makefiles
provided with the Crawl source distribution will use these
pre-generated files automatically if flex/bison is not available.

*****************************************************************************
Optional Libraries (Lua and PCRE)
---------------------------------

Lua
---

Security on multiuser systems (Unix):

Enabling Lua user scripts is unsuitable for Crawl installed setuid or
setgid - we have not audited the user scripting interface for
security. If you're not planning to install Crawl setuid/setgid (not
running set[ug]id is a good idea in general), you can enable the Lua
user-script bindings safely.

As of 0.3, the Lua source is included with Crawl. The only step needed
to enable user-scripts is to uncomment CLUA_BINDINGS in AppHdr.h.


PCRE
----

On Unixes, you're better served by the existing POSIX regular
expression support. If you want PCRE, your package management system
is again your best bet. Remember to install development headers, not
just the plain library.

On Windows, PCRE binaries are available from 
http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/pcre.htm

On DOS you get the joy of building PCRE yourself. It's a little more
annoying than building Lua (you have to roll your own makefile), but
not by much.


Unicode (Unix only)
-------------------

Modern Unixes may support Unicode terminals (particularly xterms). If
you have a terminal that can display Unicode characters, and an
ncurses library that can handle Unicode (libncursesw, and its devel
headers), you can build Crawl to display Unicode in the map: set
UNICODE_GLYPHS = y in makefile.unix.

On Mac OS X, libncurses includes Unicode support; makefile.unix should
detect Mac OS automatically and link to libncurses when
UNICODE_GLYPHS=y.

NOTE: You may have libncursesw, but not have the header files; check
that you have the header files installed as well, or you'll get a lot
of errors. Crawl expects the ncursesw headers to be in
/usr/include/ncursesw.

After compiling Crawl with Unicode support, you still need to add the
line "char_set = unicode" in your .crawlrc to tell Crawl to use
Unicode. You may also need to set the locale in your terminal (notably
on Mac OS) if the encoding does not default to UTF-8. To check this,
run "locale charmap", which should say "UTF-8". If your encoding is
not UTF-8, you can force it to UTF-8 on most systems by doing "export
LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8" or the equivalent, depending on your language
locale and what shell you're using.

If you're playing Crawl on a remote machine, the remote Crawl should
be built with Unicode support, *and* your local terminal (where you're
running telnet/ssh) needs to be able to decode UTF-8.
