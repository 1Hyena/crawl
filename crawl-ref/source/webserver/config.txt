  This needs a patch currently not in mainline tornado.
kill_timeout: Seconds until crawl is killed after HUP is sent.

  crypt() algorithm, e.g. "1" for MD5 or "6" for SHA-512; see crypt(3). If
  false, use traditional DES (but then only the first eight characters of the

  The length of the salt string to use. If crypt_algorithm is false, this
  setting is ignored and the salt is two characters.

  Set to a URL with %s where lowercased player name should go in order to
  hyperlink WebTiles spectator names to their player pages.
  For example: "http://crawl.akrasiac.org/scoring/players/%s.html".
