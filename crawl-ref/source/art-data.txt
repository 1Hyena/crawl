# This file contains the definitions of undrandarts (and what used to be
# fixed artefacts).  util/art-data.pl translates this file into
# art-data.h, and also updates the enumeration and NO_UNRANDARTS in
# unrand.h
#
# Each artefact definition is separated by one or more blanks lines.
#
# Each artefact definition must have the NAME, APPEAR, OBJ and COLOUR
# fields.
#
# The name and appearance of each unrandart must be unique.
#
# Changing the name of an unrand will change it's automatically
# generated enumeration, unless its enumeration is forced with ENUM.
#
# "ENUM: FOO" can be used to force the enumeration for an unrand to be
# "UNRAND_FOO", for cases where the automatically generated enumerations
# of different unrandarts conflict.
#
# Add new artefact definitions at the end of the file; doing so should cause
# no problems with save-file compatibilty, but for tile builds it will
# cause a shift of remembered tiles (since each new unrandart needs its
# own tiles).  Changing the order of the definitions will likely cause
# strange behaviour in games saved previous to the change, and deleting
# definitions will break savefile compatibility.
#
# Each unrandart needs two tiles, one item tile and one equipment tile for the
# player doll. The former needs to be placed into rltiles/item and defined in
# dc-item.txt, the latter in the appropriate player/ subfolder and defined in
# dc-player.txt. In tilepick.cc the unrandart must then be assigned to the tile
# name defined in the dc-***.txt.
# For a start, placeholders (e.g. reference to the base type tiles) are fine,
# but they'll eventually need to be replaced with proper tiles.

# This entry must always be first.
