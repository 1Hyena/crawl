# vaults_rooms_ghost.des: Ghost subvaults for the Vaults.
#
# Content: These are vault rooms that place a player ghost. All vaults here
# should call the function vaults_ghost_setup(). In addition to setting other
# standard tags for ghost vaults, this function will add the vaults_ghost tag
# that these vaults must have so they'll follow the global chance for placing a
# ghost vault on a level.
#
# Do not use other tag selectors like vaults_room and vaults_hard in these
# vaults, however any of the other standard vault room tags for orientation
# etc. are fine. Set a different WEIGHT to make a specific vault more or less
# common.
