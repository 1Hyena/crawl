"In the depths of every heart, there is a tomb and a dungeon, though
the lights, the music, and revelry above may cause us to forget their
existence, and the buried ones, or prisoners whom they hide. But
sometimes, and oftenest at midnight, those dark receptacles are flung
wide open. In an hour like this, when the mind has a passive
sensibility, but no active strength; when the imagination is a mirror,
imparting vividness to all ideas, without the power of selecting or
controlling them; then pray that your grieves may slumber, and the
brotherhood of remorse not break their chain."
    - Nathaniel Hawthorne
