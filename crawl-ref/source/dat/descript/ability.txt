# Zin
Recite

Preaching to monsters about Zin's laws leads to various results. It 
works best on humanoids, worse on demons and not at all on beasts.
%%%%
Vitalisation

If Zin is most pleased with you, you can Vitalise yourself. This will
restore Health, Magic, attribute points, or unrot you. In case none of
these is necessary, you gain temporary boosts to your attributes
instead. It is possible to Vitalise several times in succession for
greater effect.
