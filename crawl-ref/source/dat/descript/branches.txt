Dungeon

It is still a mystery how this bizarre place was created. Some claim that it
is the playground of bored gods, whereas others maintain that it was shaped
by all kinds of species who fled the overworld and shunned the light. No
matter what the origin of this cave is, it is filled with riches unheard of
as well as with ample dangers to any intruder. Few have escaped alive, and
even fewer have kept some rest of sanity to tell the tale.
%%%%
Temple

The Temple of some of the Gods, a place of peace and refuge from the
insanity of the dungeon.

Orcish Mines

The mines of the orcs, filled with their gold, but treacherous and easy to
get trapped in.

Elven Halls

Whereas most elven folk would never move into a dark subterranean complex
like this, the deep elves did. Their halls are filled with riches but any
passersby should be aware of the legendary magical prowess of this species.
%%%%
Lair

Most adventurers find the lair to be an exciting change of climate. And
indeed, there is something to be said about getting gored, mauled and
eaten rather than sliced, burnt or stabbed.
%%%%
Swamp

A swampy waste land, complete with ooze, muck, flies, and large slavering
carnivorous monsters.
%%%%
Shoals

From afar you hear the steady sounds of waves and smell the salty spray. 
Upon reaching the Shoals, you are impressed by exotic underground beaches, 
making up a few islands in a vast sea. Out of a sudden, a bloodcurling 
scream fills the air, followed by a gurgle. Anxiously, you look around and 
wonder: who is the predator? And who is the prey?

features only one of the Swamp or Shoals branches. If the Shoals are 
present, the entry is located between Lair: and Lair:

between Lair:8 and Lair:10.

there is a certain amount of violence, too.

The Vaults are eight levels deep and contain the silver rune. The entrance
can be found between levels 14 and 19 of the main dungeon.
%%%%
Hall of Blades

Once upon a time, all the daggers and axes and polearms would gather at the
time of night and dance the waltz, dreaming of battlefields void of man and
beast. That time is no more, yet the weapons are still there.

The Hall of Blades is a single level amd can be found between Vaults:4 and
Vaults:6.

Zot

A region of the dungeon complex, safely locked away and referred to usually by

break the seal and press deeper - in the vain hope for a fabled artefact no 
man has ever laid eyes on before.
