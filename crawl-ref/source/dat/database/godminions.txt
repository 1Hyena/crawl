# Gods taunting the player (and each other) during fight
#
# The format is:
# (god) minion taunt [minion type] [winning/losing/won]
# - winning means the timer is running out (assume player has run away)
# - won is when the timer expired and the minion disappeared
# - losing means the minion is dying and the god might encourage/shout at them
# - nothing is a generic taunt or fallback if any of the above are winning
# And:
# (god) taunt (at god) [minion type] [winning/losing/won]
# - when gods taunt each other during the fight
