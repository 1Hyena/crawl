"When Peleus, some distance away, saw him torn apart by the frightful wound he shouted: “Accept this tribute to the dead, at least, Crantor, dearest of youths, ” and with his powerful arm, he hurled his ash spear, at full strength, at Demoleon.  It ruptured the ribcage, and stuck quivering in the bone. The centaur pulled out the shaft minus its head (he tried with difficulty to reach that also) but the head was caught in his lung. The pain itself strengthened his will: wounded, he reared up at his enemy and beat the hero down with his hooves. Peleus received the resounding blows on helmet and shield, and defending his upper arms, and controlling the weapon he held out, with one blow through the arm he pierced the bi-formed breast.'"

%%%%
Symbol of Torment

This spell calls on the powers of Hell to cause agonising injury to any living thing in the caster's vicinity. It carries within itself a degree of danger, for any brave enough to invoke it, for the Symbol also affects its caller and indeed will not function if he or she is immune to its terrible effects. Despite its ominous power, this spell is never lethal. 
%%%%

This spell protects the caster from any kind of projectile attack, although particularly powerful attacks (lightning bolts, etc.) are deflected to a lesser extent than lighter missiles.

%%%%
Arc

This spell zaps at random a nearby creature with a powerful electrical current.

%%%%
Flame Tongue

This spell creates a short burst of flame.
%%%%
Passwall

This spell tunes the caster's body such that it can instantly pass through solid rock. This can be dangerous, since it is possible for the spell to expire while the caster is en route, and it also takes time for the caster to attune to the rock, during which time they will be helpless. 
%%%%
Ignite Poison

This spell attempts to convert all poison within the caster's view into liquid flame. It is very effective against poisonous creatures or those carrying poison potions. It is also an amazingly painful way to eliminate poison from one's own system.

%%%%

%%%%

%%%%
Forescry

This spell makes the caster aware of the immediate future; while not far enough to predict the result of a fight, it does give the caster ample time to get out of the way of a punch (reflexes allowing). 
%%%%
Summon Butterflies

This spell creates a shower of colourful butterflies. How pretty!
%%%%
Excruciating Wounds

This spell temporarily infuses the weapon held by the caster with the essence of pain itself. It will not affect weapons which are otherwise subject to special enchantments.
%%%%
Warp Brand

This spell temporarily binds a localized warp field to the invoker's weapon. This spell is very dangerous to cast, as the field is likely to affect the caster as well. 
%%%%
Silence

This spell eliminates all sound near the caster. This makes reading scrolls, casting spells, praying or yelling in the caster's vicinity impossible. (Applies to caster too, of course.) This spell will not hide your presence, since its oppressive, unnatural effect will almost certainly alert any living creature that something is very wrong. 
%%%%
Shatter

This spell causes a burst of concussive force around the caster, which will damage most creatures, although those composed of stone, metal or crystal, or otherwise brittle, will particularly suffer. The magic has been known to adversely affect walls. 
%%%%
Dispersal

%%%%
Discharge

%%%%
Backlight

%%%%
Intoxicate

This spell works by converting a small portion of brain matter into alcohol. It affects all intelligent humanoids within the caster's view (presumably including the caster). It is frequently used as an icebreaker at wizard parties. 
%%%%
Glamour

This spell is an Elvish magic, which draws upon the viewing creature's credulity and the caster's comeliness to charm, confuse or render comatose. 
%%%%
Evaporate

This spell heats a potion causing it to explode into a large cloud when thrown. The potion must be thrown immediately, as part of the spell, for this to work. 
%%%%
Fulsome Distillation

%%%%
Eringya's Surprising Bouquet

This spell transmutes any wooden items in the caster's grasp into a bouquet of beautiful flowers. 
%%%%
Fragmentation

This spell creates a concussive explosion within a large body of rock (or other hard material), to the detriment of any who happen to be standing nearby. 
%%%%
Air Walk

This spell transforms the caster's body into an insubstantial cloud. The caster becomes immaterial and nearly immune to physical harm, but is vulnerable to magical fire and ice. While insubstantial the caster is, of course, unable to interact with physical objects (but may still cast spells). 
%%%%
Sandblast

This spell creates a short blast of high-velocity particles. It works best when the caster provides some source (by wielding a stone), but will do what it can with whatever ambient grit is available. 
%%%%
Rotting

This spell causes the flesh of all those near the caster to rot. It will affect the living and many of the corporeal undead. 
%%%%
Maxwell's Silver Hammer

This spell bestows a lethal but temporary gravitic field to a crushing implement held by the caster. It will not affect weapons otherwise subject to special enchantments. 
%%%%
Condensation Shield

This spell causes a disc of dense vapour to condense out of the air surrounding the caster. It acts like a normal shield, but its density (and therefore stopping power) depends upon the caster's skill with Ice Magic. The disc is controlled by the caster's mind and thus will not conflict with the wielding of a two-handed weapon. 
%%%%
Stoneskin

This spell hardens one's skin to a degree determined by one's skill in Earth Magic. This only works on relatively normal flesh; it will aid neither the undead nor the bodily transformed. The effects of this spell are boosted if the caster is in Statue Form. 
%%%%
Simulacrum

This spell uses a piece of flesh in hand to create a replica of the original being out of ice. This magic is unstable so eventually the replica will sublimate into a freezing cloud, if it isn't hacked or melted into a small puddle of water first. 
%%%%
Conjure Ball Lightning

This spell allows the conjurer to create ball lightning. Using the spell is not without risk - ball lightning can be difficult to control. 
%%%%
Chain Lightning

This spell releases a massive electrical discharge that arcs from target to target until it grounds out.
%%%%
Twist

This spell causes a slight spatial distortion around a monster in line of sight of the caster, causing injury. 
%%%%
Far Strike

This spell allows the caster to transfer the force of a weapon strike to any target the caster can see. This spell will only deliver the impact of the blow; magical side-effects and enchantments cannot be transferred in this way. The force transferred by this spell has little to do with one's skill with weapons, and more to do with personal strength, translocation skill, and magic ability. 
%%%%
Swap

This spell allows the caster to swap positions with an adjacent being. 
%%%%
Apportation

This spell allows the caster to pull the top item or group of similar items from a distant pile to the floor near the caster. The mass of the target item(s) will make the task more difficult, with some items too massive to ever be moved by this spell. Using this spell on a group of items can be risky; insufficient power will cause some of the items to be lost in the infinite void.
%%%%
Portaled Projectile

This spell teleports a missile directly to its target, greatly increasing its accuracy (but not damage.)

A metal wall

A wall of bluish-grey metal.
%%%%
A wall of green crystal

For some reason, some dungeon walls, like this one, have been made of this polished crystal, imbued with arcane magics. They prevent its destruction, and make it reflect heat and cold.
%%%%
An orcish idol

An idol of Beogh
%%%%
A wall of solid wax

These walls are built by bees. Occasionally a dungeon architect will
manipulate bees into building wax walls for aesthetic reasons. (Theirs,
not the bees'.) They are susceptible to fire and will melt and burn, given
sufficient heat.

A shop

A shop in the dungeon, beyond sight of the world above, manned by a
secretive and reclusive shopkeeper who cannot be bargained with,

Some shops hawk antiques of unknown provenance, and offer little hint
as to the quality or nature of their goods.

 the abyss gazes also into you.”
    – Friedrich Nietzsche, "Beyond Good and Evil"

%%%%
A staircase to the Tomb

A way to the Tomb of the Ancients, a place of damnation, of horrors
animated by the vilest necromancy.

"In the depths of every heart, there is a tomb and a dungeon, though
the lights, the music, and revelry above may cause us to forget their
existence, and the buried ones, or prisoners whom they hide. But
sometimes, and oftenest at midnight, those dark receptacles are flung
wide open. In an hour like this, when the mind has a passive
sensibility, but no active strength; when the imagination is a mirror,
imparting vividness to all ideas, without the power of selecting or
controlling them; then pray that your grieves may slumber, and the
brotherhood of remorse not break their chain."
    - Nathaniel Hawthorne
